# Key Tester 1000

This page allows you to test the switches on your keyboard. When a key is pressed, it will turn orange & do a quick flash animation. The last pressed key is also displayed below the keyboard. The user can toggle between dark mode (default) and light mode. 

Users can now select between four keyboard layouts:
- qwerty
- colemak dh
- dvorak
- workman

## Dark mode
